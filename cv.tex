    Since the Spring of 2021 I'm de facto carrying out doctoral studies under
    supervision of Jaakko Lehtinen. The general subject of the studies are
    inverse problems in computer graphics: instead of capturing the appearance
    of things, I seek to capture a representation that would allow reproducing
    that appearance by simulation of physics.

    Recovered a legacy outsource backend project from chaotic dependencies

    other common \emph{Flask}'s fallacies and pythonic abominations (like
    threadlocals-hell or ad hoc magic instead of structured parsing and
    validation with proper error signaling)

    Couldn't help getting distracted by the research projects I was carrying out simultaneously

    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Good}:
    Avatars: my first project involving volumetric data, camera and lighting models, and such.
    I took some part in deployment of the early demos, in setting up a minimal
        dev-ops, in running experiments and writing some little pieces of the
        pipeline, and even in collecting the data.
    \end{flushleft}
    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Challenging}:
        First time in a newly formed team without any established processes. We
        had tried many configurations: from pure anarchy, to variations of
        \emph{agile}, to daily standups. That was... a valuable experience.
    \end{flushleft}
    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Meta}:
        Building trust is a process. It's tempting to
        give up sleep and try to meet a deadline you already see you're
        failing, but it is better to inform the team in advance about a
        failure. It's tempting to say ``I'll just do it my way and let people
        face the fact, because it's easier done than explained'', but no idea
        can go too far unless it's picked up by the  team and grown into a
        collective effort. Oh, by the way, it sounds only natural that one doesn't
        refactor a piece of code before writing tests for it -- but even such
        obvious rules don't apply when the communication has failed...

    \emph{Good}:
        The work mostly amounted to writing tools to check out ideas (...and I
        was supposed to do it quick -- the constraint that I'm not sure I've
        entirely satisfied), all related, roughly, to geometry processing. I
        implemented my own
        \emph{B-splines}~\citep{de1978practical,de2012splinefunktionen}, played
        with some template-based \emph{face tracking}, and
        \href{https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~karan/pdf/ksinghpaperwire.pdf}{deformation
        models}. I had some quite extensive discussions of software engineering
        practices and design with the team, and I sometimes think that perhaps
        I too made a small difference.

    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Meta}:
        I've confirmed I actually tend to over-engineer things. Over-engineered
        things are are expensive to maintain. I can be... un-easy in
        communication. On the other hand, I am by this day inspired by GNU
        Eigen's use of meta-programming. I'm pretty certain that designing
        domain-specific languages to make specific complex problems look
        simpler is exactly our bright future.

    I then generalized the result to Kronecker prodcuts of matrices, for
    simplicity only considering self-adjoint cases. The intenion was to proceed
    with a general Banachs-space setting (infinite dimensions) but never got
    around to actually carry that out.

    Having learned about the method of similar operators, I applied it to a toy

    This also resulted in my first peer-reviewed publication
