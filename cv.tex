\maketitle

In spare time I'm learning about categories, type theory, reproducible builds
with Nix, and array/GPU programming in Haskell (that's slow, because I don't
really have spare time).

\section{Industry}
\tlcventry{2020/7}{2020/9}{Backend}{Freelance}{Moscow}{}{
    \emph{Good}:
    Finished a legacy outsource backend project: introduced means for basic
    \emph{dependency injection} working around \emph{Flask}'s threadlocals-hell to
    allow mocking and integration testing (using
    \href{https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-python}{\emph{testcontainers}}),
    set up an organised parsing and validation, error signaling, CI, etc.
    \emph{Bad}: couldn't help getting distracted by concurrent research projects.

    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Good}:
    Worked with \emph{volumetric fusion}, camera \emph{calibration}, and
    undistortion; e.g. came with cheap heuristics for RGBD sequence
    \emph{decimation}.  Backend (\emph{docker}, \emph{redis}, multi-GPU,
    model-as-a-service).  Put the beginning to decomposing a 1300LOC
    \emph{pytorch}-mixed-with-IO untest\{ed|able\} core function.
    Introduced minimal \emph{DevOps} practices.  Collected data outdoors.
    \end{flushleft}
    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Challenging}:
    First time in a newly formed team without established processes.
    We'd been trying out many different configurations (from anarchy to
    \emph{agile} and daily standups) and that was a valuable experience.
    \end{flushleft}
    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Bad}: Communication: I failed to report in advance the deadlines I
    was failing, I've several times chosen to ``just do it my way without
    explaining the reasons, "because it's easier done than said"'' and of
    course that wasn't conductive to building the \emph{trust}.

    \begin{flushleft}
    \emph{Good}:
    Wrote a small
    \emph{B-splines}~\citep{de1978practical,de2012splinefunktionen} library, a
    patch-based \emph{face tracking} algo, a
    \href{https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~karan/pdf/ksinghpaperwire.pdf}{wires}-like
    deformations demo.  I may have to some extent impacted team's perspective
    on software design and processes.

    \emph{Bad}: I definitely had over-engineered many things. I wasn't easy
    in communication. I had a deadlines problem.

    online~\citep{msThesis}.  It's been a rock-opera style story of active
    search and a sampling of many different subjects (and people) -- follow the

    First \emph{real} acquiantance with a programming language (C\#).  Learned
